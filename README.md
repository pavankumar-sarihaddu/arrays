# arrays
An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value:  const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
Why Using an Array?
If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the cars in single variables could look like this:

let car1 = "Saab";
let car2 = "Volvo";
let car3 = "BMW";
However, what if you want to loop through the cars and find a specific one? And what if you had not 3 cars, but 300?

The solution is an array!

An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number.

Creating an Array
Using an array literal is the easiest way to create a JavaScript Array.

Syntax:

const array_name = [item1, item2, ...];  
Spaces and line breaks are not important. A declaration can span multiple lines:

Example
const cars = [
  "Saab",
  "Volvo",
  "BMW"
];
You can also create an array, and then provide the elements:

Example
const cars = [];
cars[0]= "Saab";
cars[1]= "Volvo";
cars[2]= "BMW";
Using the JavaScript Keyword new
The following example also creates an Array, and assigns values to it:

Example
const cars = new Array("Saab", "Volvo", "BMW");
Accessing Array Elements
You access an array element by referring to the index number:

const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
let car = cars[0];
Changing an Array Element
This statement changes the value of the first element in cars:

cars[0] = "Opel";
Example
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
cars[0] = "Opel";
Access the Full Array
With JavaScript, the full array can be accessed by referring to the array name:

Example
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = cars;
Arrays are Objects
Arrays are a special type of objects. The typeof operator in JavaScript returns "object" for arrays.

But, JavaScript arrays are best described as arrays.

Arrays use numbers to access its "elements". In this example, person[0] returns John:

Array:
const person = ["John", "Doe", 46];
Objects use names to access its "members". In this example, person.firstName returns John:

Object:
const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:46};
Array Elements Can Be Objects
JavaScript variables can be objects. Arrays are special kinds of objects.

Because of this, you can have variables of different types in the same Array.

You can have objects in an Array. You can have functions in an Array. You can have arrays in an Array:

myArray[0] = Date.now;
myArray[1] = myFunction;
myArray[2] = myCars;
Array Properties and Methods
The real strength of JavaScript arrays are the built-in array properties and methods:

cars.length   // Returns the number of elements
cars.sort()   // Sorts the array
Array methods are covered in the next chapters.

The length Property
The length property of an array returns the length of an array (the number of array elements).

Example
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
let length = fruits.length;
Accessing the First Array Element
Example
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
let fruit = fruits[0];
Accessing the Last Array Element
Example
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
let fruit = fruits[fruits.length - 1];
Looping Array Elements
One way to loop through an array, is using a for loop:

Example
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
let fLen = fruits.length;

let text = "<ul>";
for (let i = 0; i < fLen; i++) {
  text += "<li>" + fruits[i] + "</li>";
}
text += "</ul>";
You can also use the Array.forEach() function:

Example
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];

let text = "<ul>";
fruits.forEach(myFunction);
text += "</ul>";

function myFunction(value) {
  text += "<li>" + value + "</li>";
}
Adding Array Elements
The easiest way to add a new element to an array is using the push() method:

Example
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple"];
fruits.push("Lemon");  // Adds a new element (Lemon) to fruits
New element can also be added to an array using the length property:

Example
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple"];
fruits[fruits.length] = "Lemon";  // Adds "Lemon" to fruits
Associative Arrays
Many programming languages support arrays with named indexes.

Arrays with named indexes are called associative arrays (or hashes).

JavaScript does not support arrays with named indexes.

In JavaScript, arrays always use numbered indexes.  

Example
const person = [];
person[0] = "John";
person[1] = "Doe";
person[2] = 46;
person.length;    // Will return 3
person[0];        // Will return "John"
The Difference Between Arrays and Objects
In JavaScript, arrays use numbered indexes.  

In JavaScript, objects use named indexes.

Arrays are a special kind of objects, with numbered indexes.

When to Use Arrays. When to use Objects.
JavaScript does not support associative arrays.
You should use objects when you want the element names to be strings (text).
You should use arrays when you want the element names to be numbers.
JavaScript new Array()
JavaScript has a built in array constructor new Array().

But you can safely use [] instead.

These two different statements both create a new empty array named points:

const points = new Array();
const points = [];
These two different statements both create a new array containing 6 numbers:

const points = new Array(40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10);
const points = [40, 100, 1, 5, 25, 10];
How to Recognize an Array
A common question is: How do I know if a variable is an array?

The problem is that the JavaScript operator typeof returns "object":

const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple"];
let type = typeof fruits;
The typeof operator returns object because a JavaScript array is an object.

Solution 1:
To solve this problem ECMAScript 5 (JavaScript 2009) defined a new method Array.isArray():

Array.isArray(fruits);
